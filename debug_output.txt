--- FINAL VALIDATION ARTIFACT ---
Here is the formal Validation Table based on your provided test steps:

## Digital Signature Validation Table for Record Deletion (21 CFR Part 11 Compliance)

| Step ID | Procedure | Expected Result |
| :------ | :-------- | :-------------- |
| **TS-DS-001** | **Preconditions:** The user has the necessary permissions to delete a record, and a record exists in the system.<br><br>**Action:** Attempt to delete a record *without* providing a digital signature. | The system should prevent the deletion and display a message or prompt requiring a valid digital signature. |
| **TS-DS-002** | **Preconditions:** The user has the necessary permissions to delete a record, and a record exists in the system.<br><br>**Action:** Attempt to delete a record by providing an **invalid or fake** digital signature. | The system should recognize the digital signature as invalid, prevent the record deletion, and provide an appropriate error message indicating the signature is not valid. |
| **TS-DS-003** | **Preconditions:** The user has the necessary permissions to delete a record, and a record exists in the system.<br><br>**Action:** Attempt to delete a record by providing a **valid** digital signature that meets 21 CFR Part 11 requirements (e.g., includes the signer's identity, date, and time). | The system should accept the valid digital signature and successfully allow the record to be deleted. |
| **TS-DS-004** | **Preconditions:** The user has the necessary permissions to delete a record, and a record exists in the system.<br><br>**Action:** 1. Delete a record, providing a valid digital signature (as per TS-DS-003).<br>2. Review the system's audit trail or log. | The system's audit trail should contain a record of the deletion event, including:<br>- The identity of the user who performed the deletion.<br>- The date and time of the deletion.<br>- Details pertaining to the digital signature used (e.g., certificate ID, verification status) to ensure 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. |
